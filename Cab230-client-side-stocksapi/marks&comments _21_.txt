
Assignment 1 - Client Side - Marks and Comments: 
------------------------------------------------
The mark awarded here is a 'grade' in each category. We only use 'half grades' 
or full grades: 7, 6.5, 6, 5.5, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3, 2.5, 2, 1.5, 1, 0. The 
marker may manually record marks against each category, or copy and paste a 
row from our spreadsheet. Either way, these will be used to determine your 
final mark. So if you are given a 5.5 for Overall Functionality, then you will 
get: 

5.5/7.0 * 30 = 23.57 

for that category. We *won't* show those calculations here, but that is how 
your final mark will be determined. If the row from the spreadsheet is used, 
it may also show the total out of 100 as the last entry. 

Comments: 
---------
The marker may write comments only here or here and in the report. Both your 
report and the CRA are in this archive for ease of reference.
